          <p>
            For the meditation component of the Self-care, Health, and Wellness
            journey project, I joined fellow 2019 Orientation Leaders Summer,
            Maya, Jimmy, Mykayla, and Amorie for a session on Landis Green.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our guided meditation was facilitated by the free app, HeadSpace. In
            total, we spent about 20-30 minutes meditating, and about 45 minutes
            on Landis Green in total.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have prior experience with meditation, so in this case, I did not
            have much trouble deciding on a topic to focus on. I decided to
            meditate on being motivated to finish the rest of the Spring 2019
            semester strong. My previous semester was my most difficult, and
            disappointing ever, but now, I am doing better than I ever have in
            college, because I am determined to be eligible for the official
            Orientation Leader spot come summer. After Spring Break, I was
            initially feeling detached from school, and had lost sight of the
            very reason I had worked so hard in the first place. This meditation
            session was helpful for me because I reflected upon the reasons I
            wanted to do well, and helped me decide to re-focus on studying
            consistently, and managing my time well, so that I could continue to
            do well on assignments and tests.
          </p>
          <p>
            That day was a specifically quiet day on Landis Green - there were
            no political messengers with loudspeakers, nor any tents from
            student organizations up. In fact, the ambience of Landis Green that
            day was extremely calm. This made it much easier to meditate. I am
            someone who typically meditates in the quiet, private space of my
            own room, so it being quiet outside was the main reason I was able
            to successfully meditate outside.

        <div class="title">Counseling Center Event - Coffee Hour</div>
        <div class="subtitle">
          <p>
            I attended the International Coffee Hour, where RENEW was doing a
            tabling activity, where guests could have one-on-one conversations
            with members, and connect in a conversation about mental health.
          </p>
          <p>
            The International Coffee Hour is an event held in the Globe every
            Friday, the main purpose of which is usually for guests to meet and
            converse with other students on campus. Oftentimes, it is hosted by
            an on-campus organization, and said organization may conduct an
            activity concurrently. In this case, guests were instructed to take
            a "Passport" card, and complete at least two activities, in order to
            receive a small prize.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first activity I participated in was called "Guess the
            Language"; I was successfully able to guess which language 10
            translations of a document detailing the purpose of the Counseling
            Center were written in. Though on the surface it was a simple quiz,
            its purpose was very clear to me - to not only demonstrate the fact
            that the Counseling Center is a resource that works very hard to
            ensure students have support for any mental circumstances they may
            face, but also that the organization is unassuming, and does not
            discriminate against students. Whether you speak another language,
            or no matter what situation you are going through, you can find
            support at the Counseling Center.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second activity was called "Finding Connections," and involved
            stepping outside and having a two-minute conversation with two
            student members of RENEW. They pulled questions out of a cup, and
            used those as the basis of conversation. This questions were
            intended to provoke a deeper conversation about ways people can find
            support when they are not at their best mentally.
          </p>
          <p>
            After completing the two activities, I was given a small stress
            ball, in the shape of a globe. By the end of the event, I felt very
            much reassured. I, like many other students, have gone through
            periods where I was struggling mentally, and had I been willing to
            seek help at the time, could have found outstanding support. I have
            confidence in the fact that I can visit the Counseling Center when
            counseling is what I need.

        <p>
          Though I did not physically attend, I researched the
          <a href="https://www.chabadtallahassee.com/"
            >Chabad Lubavitch of Tallahassee</a
          >, a Jewish ministry in the FSU InterFaith Council. The Chabad
          Lubavitch does a lot of outreach and programming, including "Friday
          Night Live," an event that targets FSU students, and aims to provide a
          space for them to interact with one another. The event is held weekly,
          and a Shabbat dinner is served. The Chabad Lubavitch is also active
          and vocal in Tallahassee, speaking at events like the recent
          inauguration of Governor Ron DeSantis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many students practice an organized religion, or are otherwise active
          spiritually, whether it is through meditation, or another practice.
          One's spirituality can be extremely beneficial to wellbeing,
          especially when it comes to matters of mental health. As someone who
          was raised Christian, I have seen firsthand how people who have gone
          through extreme adversity are able to motivate themselves to continue
          giving life a chance when they have faith in a benefactor watching
          over them. Regardless of one's beliefs, spirituality has the power to
          give people hope that nothing tangible is even remotely capable of
          doing. Besides just faith, most organized religions are communal
          activities, and religious student organizations provide avenues for
          students to meet others of the same faith, and to form long-lasting
          relationships with others who genuinely care about them. I myself have
          joined my local church's band, and that has been virtually my only
          musical involvement while in Tallahassee. Music is so important to me,
          and plays such an important role - being a member of my church has
          opened the door for me to do something I love, in the context of my
          faith.

        <div class="subtitle">
          <p>
            Before completing the Student Resilience Project, I had a different
            idea of what resilience was. I believed that resilience was simply
            the quality of being able to approach difficult situations without
            showing visible signs of wear or frustration. Typically, when I
            thought of people who were resilient, I thought of famous figures,
            like Martin Luther King, Jr., or Maxine Waters, who faced adversity
            with sheer indignation and a refusal to take things passively. In my
            mind, this is what being resilient was all about - being a
            "trooper," and being strong enough to take any blow without
            conceding so much as even a scratch.
          </p>
          <p>
            After completing the Student Resilience Project, however, I gained
            some new insight about another definition of resilience. Though I
            still feel that what it takes to be resilient is this ability to
            recognize situations that dissatisfy you, and take matters into your
            own hands to correct them, I no longer think that one has to deny
            and avoid their pain to be resilient. My previous definition could
            be applied to pain itself - part of being resilient is being able to
            look your pain square in the eye, accept it for what it is, and
            prioritize self-care, so that you can have strength again to fight
            another day.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's really not as easy as I may have made it sound above, but I
            believe that the first step to being resilient is for me to at least
            come up with a definition and framework for what resilience even is,
            in the first place. With this new goal in mind, I had a clearer
            picture of ways I wanted to care better for myself.

        <div class="title">Reflection - Hazing</div>
        <div class="subtitle">
          <p>
            I completed the
            <a href="https://hazing.fsu.edu/test-your-knowledge"
              >Hazing - Test Your Knowledge</a
            >
            challenge. I was expecting to get every question correct; however, I
            missed one question. I was unaware that hazing charges could result
            in a third degree for those convicted. Typical hazing stories
            involve things like underage drinking, staying up late, and wearing
            suits to class, which don't typically immediately jump out at you as
            things warranting a felony. However, the stories which I've heard in
            the
            <i>news</i> have resulted in outcomes like student death, or serious
            injury, so I can understand that things like that should be
            criminally punished, and agree.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am not involved with or affiliated with any organizations that
            engage in hazing practices, but it is very clear to me how being
            hazed can affect a student, especially one who is new to college.
            Even things that might seem minor, like keeping pledges up late, can
            be detrimental to self-care. Without sleep, it is difficult to pay
            attention in class, to be productive, and to live a healthy
            lifestyle. This is a double-whammy punch, as it'll also be hard to
            find time to study and make up the time you missed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides just school, being hazed can seriously affect one's health.
            Excessive drinking is a common hazing activity, which, for obvious
            reasons, is not healthy. Extreme drinking can lead to alcohol
            poisoning, or even death, and often causes people to do things they
            regret, which may even be criminal offenses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, hazing seriously throws the balance of a student's life off
            course, and makes it nearly impossible to conduct one's self in a
            healthy, responsible way. It is extremely important to know not only
            the dangers of hazing, but how to prevent it, and report it when it
            happens. At the end of the day, it is about keeping fellow students
            safe. One person can have a large impact, if they have the right
            tools available to them.

        <div class="subtitle">
          <p>
            The first item I selected, and maybe the most important, was my
            <b>OL water bottle</b>. I have been working hard all semester long
            to get back into the shape I previously was in, and truly, it has
            been a hard grind. One difficulty I have found myself running into
            is that as school work progressively gets harder, and stress mounts,
            exercising regularly and eating healthy becomes less of a priority
            for me. However, I have been able to identify some habits I had
            developed that led to unhealthy eating, weight gain, and overall
            frustration with my progress, or lack thereof. The most important
            thing I can do is to drink water the moment I wake up. In the
            morning, I often feel hungrier than I actually am. Drinking even
            just a little bit of water fills me up a bit, and reminds me that I
            maybe don't need to eat more than what can fit on a single plate.
          </p>
          <p>
            My second choice was a <b>MIDI keyboard</b>. I pride myself in being
            a person who loves music, and has the production know-how necessary
            to create good-sounding music worth releasing. However, for all the
            practicing I've ever done, the only music I've ever put on Spotify
            was a 4-song EP I released in high school. I've been telling myself
            for literally two years that I would put something out, but what
            really ends up happening is that I pack up my music gear, and shove
            it under my bed, while I sort the rest of my life together. Music
            itself is not my self-care goal, but my goal
            <i>is</i>
            to have my life to the point where I can comfortably do some sort of
            musical activity often, and maybe even release my record soon.
          </p>
          <p>
            My third object, a pair of <b>studio headphones</b>, is also
            musical, but rather than serving as an eventual goal to attain, it
            is a reminder to myself that on stressful days, I can sit and listen
            to music to calm down. I have noticed that on the days where I feel
            the most drained, and the most irritable, I usually have not had any
            opportunity to listen to and sing along to music. I try hard to
            listen to music every day, and it is one of the few activities that
            helps me balance and center myself, and keep my emotions in order.
            This semester, I have had several days where I don't listen to
            music, and feel like the end of the world is imminent. So, I
            included the headphones, so that I can be sure to ground myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            My fourth object, <b>face wash</b>, is not nearly as trivial as it
            might seem without context. I am a person who takes at least one
            shower every day; however, there are times, especially during
            stressful periods, where I slack on face and skin care. As someone
            who periodically has eczema flares, this can lead to prolonged
            frustration, as at times, I might encounter areas of dry skin that
            do not go away for a long time. This bottle of face wash is now
            sitting in my shower, so that I can be sure to use it every time I
            bathe.
          </p>
          <p>
            My final object is a <b>PC game controller</b>, and serves to remind
            me to take some time out of my busy life to enjoy things. As any of
            my friends might tell you, I am truly a work-a-holic, and spend
            almost every waking hour doing some sort of project, or attempting
            to learn something new. Historically, it's been rare for me to
            specifically reserve leisure time. This semester, though, I bought a
            copy of NBA 2K19 for PC, and have been making time to slowly play
            it, and enjoy my weekends.

          Overall, this journey project was really and truly a journey. It
          reinforced for me the importance of taking care of myself, and beyond
          that, demonstrated to me that there are many different ways to take
          care of myself - where it be meditation, religious involvement,
          avoiding and preventing hazing, visiting the Counseling Center, or
          even making a self-care kit. Most of these things were not activities
          I regularly engaged - for example, I had never been to the University
          Counseling Center. Yet, it is important to note that I completed the
          entire journey project while on campus. There are many resources
          available to me to manage my health and well-being, they can all
          assist me with self-care, and they are all very accessible to me as an
          FSU student. As a Spring 2019 Orientation Leader, I can use what I
          have learned to help incoming students, and share my experiences with
          students who might go through some of the same challenges that I went
          through. Though this journey was about self-care, I am determined to
          take what I have learned, and use it to help others take better of
          their selves, and inspire them to share the message as well.
